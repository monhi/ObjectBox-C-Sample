# ObjectBox-C-Sample
This is a sample project to show how the ObjectBox database is working.
ObjectBox is a NoSQL database that is perfect for Edge devices.
In this project, a simple Tasklist is created and maintained.

Every record in the DB has four fields:
* Task ID
* Start time
* End time
* Task description

The project is developed by using MS Visual C++ 2015.
You need to copy the Objectbox.dll from Lib folder to the execution path.
Do not forget to compile the project in x86 mode because the Objectbox.dll is compiled for x86 architecture.
