# ObjectBox-C-Sample
This is a sample project to show how the ObjectBox database is working.
ObjectBox is a NoSQL database that is perfect for Edge devices.
In this project, a simple Tasklist is created and maintained.

Every record in the DB has four fields:
* Task ID
* Start time
* End time
* Task description

The project is developed by using MS Visual C++ 2015 and can be compiled and used in both x64 and x86 modes. 
You need to copy the dedicated `Objectbox.dll` file from the Lib64 or Lib86 folder to the execution path.
